# Collection on mini projects in R

1.  HousePrices. The file housing.csv contains 500 observations with house prices and 8 additional house characteristics. The project performs EDA, detects outliers, does model selection out of set of linear regressions and compares, interprets the results.
2.  Olympics. The project develops model for predicting the number of medals won by each country at the Rio Olympics in 2016 using information that was available prior to the Games. At the data exploration step missing values are treated and variable engineering performed. A set of GLM models is tested: Linear regression, Binomial model, Poisson model, Quasi-Poisson model, Negative-Binomial model, Linear-mixed model. Negative Binomial model is selected based on performance.
